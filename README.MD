Brayden  -  I helepd make this README.md and I added some pictures to this website. I also added links and I changed the github icon to take you to my github and the youtube icon to take you to YouTube.com. i added pictures to the static file so that we can use them. 
Billy  -   added to the read me and was able to customize the buttons and links to fit our project.The 2 parts I was assigned was the lunch and dessert pages and I did all of the code on those two templates. I also created our shopping bag icon and template.

## Youtube and Shopping Cart Icons
You can click on the youtube icon that will take you to a page that will provide you with easy to make dishes. The shopping cart icon is where you can add recipes and foods you want to buy to your bag.




# Requirements we hit 



## Usage of Github
We used Github to share code so we could all make our own adjustments without messing up the main. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We all tried to switch to this because Repl was giving us problems. Brayden switched from VS Code to InteliJ. We all followed along with the video from Dane in class this week
## Usage of Flask and routes
We used flask to make our webiste and we had many app.route so that when you click on the word, it brings you to a new webpage
## Usage of bootstrap
We used bootstrap while making our dropdown menu. 
## Usage of Jinja
